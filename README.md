Warehouse Management System for Mikefel Enterprise
Mikefel Enterprise operates a central warehouse that stocks a variety of items. From this warehouse, the company distributes products to its various branches located across Ghana. To streamline this distribution process and improve efficiency, Mikefel Enterprise has implemented a Warehouse Management System (WMS).
This system, built on the Laravel PHP framework, enables real-time tracking and management of inventory, making it easier to oversee stock levels, monitor stock movements, and optimize the supply chain across all branches.
Technologies Used:

    Backend: PHP (Laravel Framework)
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
